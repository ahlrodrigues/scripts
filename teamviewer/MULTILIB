A working teamviewer in 64 bit environment were requested by many users, but
it requires multilib environment, in which the maintainer can't provide and
not officially supported by SBo.

This document is a contribution from Gerardo Zamudio. It's UNTESTED by the
maintainer. If you have any issues please ask your questions to him directly.

1. Full install of Slackware64 14.2

2. Install multilib from alienBOB repository

3. Download teamviewer.tar.gz , change ARCH=x86_64 (not really necessary,
just for the package tag) and DEBARCH=amd64 (just to find the .deb
source) , use teamviewer_amd64.deb

4. Install TeamViewer
